# OYO Hospitality Revenue Analysis
This repository contains a data analysis project focused on analyzing hospitality revenue data from OYO, a leading global hospitality company. The project aims to extract insights and trends from the revenue data, identify key factors influencing revenue generation, and provide data-driven recommendations for improving revenue performance.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset specifically collected from OYO's revenue records, containing information such as booking details, room types, pricing, customer demographics, and revenue generated over a certain period. The dataset may also include additional variables such as customer ratings, seasonal factors, and geographical data to provide a comprehensive analysis.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key components:

+ Data Cleaning and Preparation: The initial step involves cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis. This may include handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting inconsistencies, and transforming the data into a suitable format for analysis.

+ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In this phase, various statistical and visual techniques are applied to explore the dataset. EDA helps in understanding the distribution of variables, identifying outliers, exploring relationships between variables, and uncovering initial insights that can guide further analysis.

+ Revenue Analysis: The revenue data is analyzed to gain insights into revenue trends, patterns, and drivers. This involves analyzing revenue by different dimensions such as time (monthly, quarterly, or annually), room types, customer segments, or geographical locations.

+ Data Visualization: Visualizations are created using tools such as Power BI to present the findings in a visually appealing and informative manner. Charts, graphs, and dashboards are used to illustrate revenue trends, performance metrics, and correlations between variables, enabling stakeholders to comprehend the insights easily.

+ Business Recommendations: Based on the analysis results, actionable recommendations are provided to improve revenue performance. These recommendations could include pricing strategies, promotional offers, targeted marketing campaigns, or operational changes to optimize revenue generation. The recommendations are derived from the insights gained during the data analysis process.
